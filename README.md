# Loan-Risk-Prediction

Predict the risk status of a bank loan by using `Naïve-Bayes`, `Decision Tree`, and `Random Forest` algorithms. The variable `default` in the dataset indicates whether the applicant did default on the loan issued by the bank. 
The dataset classifies people described by a set of attributes as good or bad credit risks. The response variable is default. It is originally from Professor Dr. Hans Hofmann and comprises 17 variables as following: <br />
**checking_balance, months_loan_duration, credit_history, purpose, amount, savings_balance, employment_duration, percent_of_income, years_at_residence, Age, other_credit, housing, existing_loans_count, job, dependents, phone, default**<br />
(the explanation of these variables is in “Data Explanation” sub-section)<br />

As guidance for good results as following:<br />
- The preprocessing steps are done, and holding out a test / cross validation set for an estimate of the model's performance on unseen data<br />
- The model's performance is sufficiently explained (accuracy may not be the most helpful metric here! Recall about what you've learned regarding specificity and sensitivity) <br />
- Demonstrating extra effort in evaluating his/her model, and proposes ways to improve the accuracy obtained from the initial model <br />
